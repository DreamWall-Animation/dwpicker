## **History**
2021, Christmas is approaching, and the cold is setting in. Suddenly, a decision from afar—quite strange from a commercial perspective—puts us in a tough spot. We learn that we’re about to lose access to over 200 pickers used in our productions. A hundred animators, both in-house and at our partners, are going to be stuck.

We rolled up our sleeves in a rush and quickly coded a solution to keep things running. It turns out that many other studios found themselves in the same situation.

To ensure this situation could never happen again, we simply decided to make our work available to all animators worldwide under an Open Source and free license, guaranteeing that the tool will always be available for free.

Enjoy ! ;D
