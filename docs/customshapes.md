# Custom Shapes

Each button can be square, round, a rounded square, or a "custom shape." A custom shape is a unique vector-based design composed of a single shell. However, rendering custom shapes is 50 times slower than basic ones, so they should be used sparingly. Using over 1,000 custom shapes can significantly reduce FPS.


### Data
