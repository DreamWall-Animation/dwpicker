### Support
Preferably, post an issue on the [github page](https://github.com/DreamWall-Animation/dwpicker/issues).

If you don't hold a github account, you can send a mail to `brouyere |a| dreamwall.be`.Please start you mail subjects by ***[dwpicker]***. (Note that the replying delay can be longer using that way).
